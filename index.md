**1. What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**\
The most interesting topic covered in my domain is data visualization. It has been something that has intrigued me since the beginning, so much so that I decided to be part of the group creating the visualizations. Creating an effective visualization is just as important as the data that it represents. I would like to help patients understand their own health data, so they can be better informed about what is going on in their bodies. 

**2. Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.**\
I would like to investigate the timelines of common diseases, in order to determine what biomarkers appear for a disease before the symptoms do. 

**3. What is a potential change youâ€™d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**\
A potential change I would make is make creating synthetic data more of a priority. It is completely understandable given the domain we are working in that data will be scarce, but it is still useful for creating dummy visualizations. 

**4. What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**\
I would be interested in implementing statistical techniques other than pearson correlation in the dashboard we are creating.
